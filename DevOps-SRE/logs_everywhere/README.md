# Obornes DevOps/SRE Challenge

## Logs Everywhere

This challenge is composed of multiple parts. You should add the code that solves each part to its specific folder.

The goal of this challenge is to start implementing file parsing and end part 4 with a simple REST API. You should write code that is easy to change otherwise, this challenge is going to take more time than it needs. 

A sample log file is provided to help you develop the challenge. Please be aware that, for the sake of simplicity the log file is quite small, but your solution should scale and be able to run for bigger files as well.

If you still think there is room for optimization, you can bring your ideas to the interview. Well-written code, following best practices is more important here. 

#### Guidelines:

* Do the simplest thing that could work for each part.
* Each part folder should have an executable specific to that part.
* You can use multiple files to solve the problem.
* Keep in mind that your solution should be easy to maintain.
* Keep the .git folder.
* Keep in mind that you should avoid reinventing the wheel (you can use libraries).
* You can pick the language that you're most comfortable with.
* Implementing unit tests is a bonus, but it would be _truly appreciated_.
* You should provide a Dockerfile to easily run your solution.

PS: You can send your solution to the person you're talking to.

We hope you enjoy the challenge. Keep it simple and happy coding.
