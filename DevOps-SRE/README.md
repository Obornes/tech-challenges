## DevOps/SRE Challenges

This repository is divided into multiple challenges. You can pick either the challenge "**Playing with Metrics**", "**Logs Everywhere!**" or "**Time to vote!**" . Feel free to choose the one that you enjoy more.

The architectural question is open-ended. If you don't have the time to solve it now, it's fine, we can discuss the solution during the interview.

Please store your solution on a **public repository** on a free platform of your choice (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, ...) if the challenge **doesn't specify a delivery method**. You should also provide a **README.md** with instructions on running your code and tests for each part of the challenges.
